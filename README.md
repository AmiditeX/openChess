# openChess
C++ console chess

Update on development status as of 2020-09-12:

openChess is now pretty much regular chess. game will end on checkmate, although the algorithm to check if the current check can be blocked is a bit inefficient.

Added castling as a move as well

to be added:

- en passant pawn capture

- stalemate, draw due to lack of material, etc.

- colored text / background for pieces / unshaded squares

Update on development status as of 2020-09-07:

Player turns, pieces can only be moved if the move is valid. Prevent piece jumping with bishops, rooks, queens, initial pawn double move. Pawn promotion.

TBA: colored text for pieces, game-ending stuff
